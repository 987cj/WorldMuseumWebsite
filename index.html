		<h1>The World Museum</h1>

		<p>The World Museum is an institution of scientific curiosity and cultural connection, with a proud history as one of the world's oldest museums. It is a stronghold for our scientific and historic past, continuing to educate its many guests and assisting researchers to solve the biggest problems of our world.

			<h2>Strategy</h2>

			<p>
				Digitisation is a process where we take information from physical objects and store them in a digital database. This will allow faster and easier access of information to scientists, organisations and communities that need them, as well as improve management of assets, both digital and physical. This is already being done with museums all over the world, and with the World Museum's rich history and collections, this is bound to make a huge positive impact to the communities they serve.

			<h2>Special Considerations</h2>
			<h3>Environment</h3>
				<p>
					On the environmental side, we are committed to keeping the museum’s carbon footprint low. We plan to use low-energy cameras and equipment for capturing images. All the data will be stored in cloud platforms that already run on renewable energy, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. These services are carbon neutral and continue to invest in sustainability. Once the data is uploaded and doesn’t need to be accessed often, we’ll move it to a sustainable backup system that uses very little power, helping the museum reduce ongoing energy use.
				</p>
				<p>
By combining respect for culture with smart, sustainable technology, this plan protects the collection, supports community ownership and keeps the museum’s environmental impact as low as possible. It is about doing the right thing; both for people and for the planet.
				</p>
			<h3>Cultural</h3>
				<p>
					Many of the items in the museum’s collection hold deep cultural meaning. For Indigenous communities, these objects are not just artefacts. They are part of living traditions, stories and identity. This means we must treat them with respect. We believe that ethical digitisation means doing more than just taking photos. It means including the people the objects belong to in the process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our plan includes working side by side with Indigenous communities to add cultural meaning to the database. We will allow communities to help describe the objects in their own language and from their own point of view. Some objects may need to have limited access to protect cultural knowledge and our system will respect that by using tiered access levels. This gives communities more control and helps build trust.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also recognise that many of these communities are in remote areas. Because of this, we propose using a mobile app that works offline. It can be used during field trips where there’s no internet. Staff can gather information, stories and context directly from community members and upload it later when they’re back online. This approach avoids the need to move fragile or sensitive items and supports safe, respectful data collection.
