			<p class="endp">The World Museum is an institution of scientific curiosity and cultural connection, with a proud history as one of the world's oldest museums. It is a stronghold for our scientific and historic past, continuing to educate its many guests and assisting researchers to solve the biggest problems of our world.

				<h2>Strategy</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					Digitisation is a process where we take information from physical objects and store them in a digital database. This will allow faster and easier access of information to scientists, organisations and communities that need them, as well as improve management of assets, both digital and physical. This is already being done with museums all over the world, and with the World Museum's rich history and collections, this is bound to make a huge positive impact to the communities they serve.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our digitisation strategy follows eight core business priorities that drive every decision we make. These priorities encompass everything from improving how we track and inventory items to providing broader access, supporting conservation efforts, and deepening cultural engagement. By designing our plan around these goals, we ensure that each object is digitised to a high standard that satisfies our curators, archivists, and community partners. The goal is clear: better tracking and management of objects, wider access for researchers and the public, stronger preservation data for conservators, and richer digital experiences that honor and engage the cultures these artifacts represent.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Populated Asset Register (Database)</b>: A comprehensive digital record of all collection items.</li>
					<li><b>Location Tracking</b>:Locations of all objects recorded and tracked digitally.</li>
					<li><b>Standardised Processes</b>:Consistent procedures for asset and information management.</li>
					<li><b>Imaging</b>:Capture of images, including selective high-quality imaging of objects across collections.</li>
					<li><b>Context</b>:Enrichment of digital register with research, scientific data, cultural histories, and advanced imagery.</li>
					<li><b>Conservation</b>:Measures to ensure the safety, security, and quality of physical objects.</li>
					<li><b>Access</b>:Facilitating digital repatriation and knowledge sharing with the broader community.</li>
					<li><b>Technology Platform</b>: Implementation of a performant and consistent system for managing digital assets.</li>

				<h2>Timeline</h2>
				<hr/>

				<h3>Year 1</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Establish digitisation teams and protocols.</li>
					<li>Pilot DSLR digitisation for all non-liquid, non-frozen objects.</li>
					<li>Develop metadata standards and a classification system.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Year 2</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Begin 3D scanning Pinned and Small Dry Objects (12.5 million items).</li>
					<li>Scan select Large Dry Objects by dividing them into smaller parts.</li>
					<li>Expand hardware and software infrastructure for digitisation.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Year 3</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Apply AR/VR technologies to digitised data.</li>
					<li>Create interactive experiences (e.g., virtual prehistoric environments).</li>
					<li>Begin virtual exhibition prototyping.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Year 4</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Develop preservation-first strategies for Liquid Preserved and Frozen Tissue Samples.</li>
					<li>Use controlled environments and proxy representations (e.g., digital twins).</li>
					<li>Avoid physical scanning where risk is too high.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Year 5</h3>
				<ul class="endp">
					<li>Finalise digitisation of all accessible objects.</li>
					<li>Launch public-facing digital platform with search tools and AR/VR experiences.</li>
					<li>Collaborate with cultural and educational institutions for broader impact.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Special Considerations</h2>
				<hr/>
				<h3>Environment</h3>
					<p>
						On the environmental side, we are committed to keeping the museum’s carbon footprint low. We plan to use low-energy cameras and equipment for capturing images. All the data will be stored in cloud platforms that already run on renewable energy, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. These services are carbon neutral and continue to invest in sustainability. Once the data is uploaded and doesn’t need to be accessed often, we’ll move it to a sustainable backup system that uses very little power, helping the museum reduce ongoing energy use.
					</p>
					<p>
	By combining respect for culture with smart, sustainable technology, this plan protects the collection, supports community ownership and keeps the museum’s environmental impact as low as possible. It is about doing the right thing; both for people and for the planet.
					</p>
				<h3>Cultural</h3>
					<p>
						Many of the items in the museum’s collection hold deep cultural meaning. For Indigenous communities, these objects are not just artefacts. They are part of living traditions, stories and identity. This means we must treat them with respect. We believe that ethical digitisation means doing more than just taking photos. It means including the people the objects belong to in the process.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our plan includes working side by side with Indigenous communities to add cultural meaning to the database. We will allow communities to help describe the objects in their own language and from their own point of view. Some objects may need to have limited access to protect cultural knowledge and our system will respect that by using tiered access levels. This gives communities more control and helps build trust.
					</p>
					<p class="endp">
						We also recognise that many of these communities are in remote areas. Because of this, we propose using a mobile app that works offline. It can be used during field trips where there’s no internet. Staff can gather information, stories and context directly from community members and upload it later when they’re back online. This approach avoids the need to move fragile or sensitive items and supports safe, respectful data collection.
